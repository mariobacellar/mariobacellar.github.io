		<div><p><b>Mario Bacellar</b> <br> Integration Architect Specialist  <br><font size=1>April 14, 2018 </font></p> </div>
		
			<p>There’s a story (here in Brazil) that in Ceará's state, there was a time when people were marked for death. </p>
			<p>
			<p>During that time, some people decided to eliminate a certain criminal who was terrorizing the region. </p>
			<p>
			<p>So, they called a 'cangaceiro' (a bandit kind of) to kill this criminal, who had quite a résumé of deadly victims. </p>
			<p>
			<p>But before the cangaceiro' accepted the job, they warned him that the mission would be very difficult since this criminal was well-guarded by his henchmen.  
			<p>
			<p><b>The employers then asked the cangaceiro:</b>
			<p><b>"Are you still willing to do it? Do you have the courage for this?"<br>
			       "To which the cangaceiro replied: Courage, I don’t know... but I do have habit."</b>
			<p>
			<div> <image src='cangaceiro.jpeg'> </div>

		
			<p>
			<p>When I read this passage from the book "O velho e o menino" (from  Roberto Tranjan), I couldn’t help but laugh. 
			<p>
			<p>Not long ago, I was doing a job interview over Skype, and my future employers (who had already read my résumé) were only asking me about things (acronyms) that weren’t in my résumé.
			<p>
			<p>In the interview, I answered "...no..." to almost all the questions. So, I thought I wouldn’t get the job.
			<p>
			<p>That’s when they asked me an abstract question, the kind of open-ended question that doesn’t have a right or wrong answer. 
			<p>
			<p>Maybe they wanted to hire me (based on my résumé), but needed to hear something that sounded like a YES.
			<p>
			<p>And that’s when my answer was very similar to that of our 'cangaceiro'.
			<p>
			<p>That was a while ago, and I passed the interview. 
			<p>
			<p>I was lucky because the interviewers worked in IT and knew how to assess my "habit" (just like the cangaceiro in the story). 
			<p>
			<p>I recalled that story now as I read about our cangaceiro, who was just "too used to it"… LOL.
			<p>
			<p>
			<p>
			<p>Technology training, at least from what I see in Brazil, is in question! 
			<p>
			<p>Academy (university) training teaches you to think (habit), it doesn’t teach you to be a tool (courage) or a set of acronyms!
			<p>
			<p>From my own experience, I know that the "habit" in this story can also come from accumulated experience, where it doesn’t matter (up to a point) how complex the work (technological challenge) the professional will <p>have to face. 

			<p>But if the professional only values their courage (IT acronyms), when they run into one they’ve never heard of or an HR interviewer… that’s it… they’ll feel excluded, worthless!
			<p>
			<p>
			<p>
			<p>As far as I’m concerned, programming a computer these days is at least 10x LESS COMPLICATED than it was in the 80's !
			<p>
			<p>And that’s very good for the development of society. We need it to be that way. I’m not complaining, no! Times have changed. 
			<p>
			<p>This ease exists for many reasons (which could be several posts on their own...). 
			<p>
			<p>But to stay on point with our cangaceiro, I’ll just focus on IT acronyms.
			<p>
			<p>With the rise of various frameworks (see Serverless Architecture Patterns) for developing solutions (this could also be several posts…), any web user can choose whether to develop drag-end-drop (no code) or with a <p>little bit of code, which is merely configuration within some framework. No prejudice, it’s just a fact. 

			<p>
			<p>
			<p>In the U.S., for example, many business users already create their own solutions to analyze data and assist in decision-making. They no longer wait for IT.
			<p>
			<p>They can even create a fairly efficient IT solution. And we all make our living at the end of the day... (well, if that's all that's at stake... fine!)
			<p>
			<p>But just as anyone can fry an egg, there are chefs who make a 'feast' with just an egg and a little seasoning (and that’s intentional). 
			<p>
			<p>The question is whether the client just wants to satisfy their hunger or enjoy a meal. Everything in its time! :)
			<p>
			<p>
			<p>
			<p>With this myriad of technological acronyms and the most agile management trends, the search for good IT professionals, in my view, is comparable to the 12 labors of Hercules.
			<p>
			<p>Well, if it’s not that complicated for those who 'breathe IT' (like the people who interviewed me), at least I think it must be for the human resources departments. 
			<p>
			<p>They don’t even conduct their own tests anymore. That is, HR professionals, for IT companies, merely tick off whether the candidate has this or that acronym on their CV. 
			<p>
			<p>It’s the liquid selection [of candidates] of these new times! 
			<p>
			<p>
			<p><b>So, what matters more, courage or habit?</b>
			<div> <image src='coragem.habito.2.jpeg'> </div>
		
			<p><b>I don’t know, buddy... courage can fail when faced with a challenge that scares the 'cangaceiro'… LOL.</p>
			<p>But the one with the habit has already fulfilled the promise before the spit dries on the ground, in this Brazilian IT Caatinga (in Ceará state, is like Mojave desert).</b> </p>
			<p>
			<br><font size=1>
			<p>P.S.: With the liquidity(*) of things being promoted every day, I believe this is also happening in all areas.</p>
			<p>(*) Look up: Liquid Love, Liquid World, Liquid Profile (multi-skilled professionals), blah blah Liquid, Liquid is the buzzword, which came to prove its lack of flexibility… haha.</p></font>
